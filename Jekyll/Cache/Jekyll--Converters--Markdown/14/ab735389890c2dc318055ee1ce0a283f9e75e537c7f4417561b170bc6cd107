I"¾<p>This little post is about what I have learned from my 7 month ML journey. Hope a newbie like me found something to invest his/her 5 minutes in this.</p>

<p>About 7 months ago, I seriously started to focus in ML field. And right now, I have done many considerable good things. I have done projects like â€œ<a href="https://github.com/prashant-kikani/toxic-comment-classifier">toxic-comment-classifier</a>â€, â€œsarcasm-detectorâ€, â€œmovie-recommenderâ€ etc. And some â€œnon-MLâ€ projects like image-optimizer and an online gaming site to play Tic-Tac-Toe against unbeatable bot. Also I am an â€œexpertâ€ in Kaggle kernels and doing summer Internship in Deep learning in Bangalore, India.</p>
