I"∂	<p>This little post is about what I have learned from my 7 month ML journey. Hope a newbie like me found something to invest his/her 5 minutes in this.</p>

<p>About 7 months ago, I seriously started to focus in ML field. And right now, I have done many considerable good things. I have done projects like ‚Äú<a href="https://github.com/prashant-kikani/toxic-comment-classifier">toxic-comment-classifier</a>‚Äù, ‚Äú<a href="https://github.com/prashant-kikani/sarcasm-detector-by-CNN">sarcasm-detector</a>‚Äù, ‚Äú<a href="https://github.com/prashant-kikani/movie-recommender">movie-recommender</a>‚Äù etc. And some ‚Äúnon-ML‚Äù projects like <a href="https://github.com/prashant-kikani/image-optimizer">image-optimizer</a> and an online gaming site to play Tic-Tac-Toe against unbeatable bot. Also I am an ‚Äú<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/prashantkikani">expert</a>‚Äù in Kaggle kernels and doing summer Internship in Deep learning in Bangalore, India.</p>

<p>I will divide this post in 3 parts.</p>
<ul>
  <li>How to start?</li>
  <li>How to grow?</li>
  <li>How to maintain?</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="how-to-start">How to start?</h1>

<p>This question is very common in almost all of the aspirants. One basic analogy is, one needs to have at least basic knowledge of statistics, calculus (specially for Deep Learning) and linear algebra to understand concepts of Machine Learning &amp; Deep Learning. Remember I have said ‚Äúbasic‚Äù. You don‚Äôt need to be expert in it. And if you have done high school studies good, you most probably have it. So, congrats. You already have base of ML!!</p>

<p>While starting, remember on thing. Learn in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search">BFS</a> manner, not in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search">DFS</a> manner. What I want to say is, try to grasp overall idea of each and every concept of ML. Don‚Äôt just pick one algorithm and do very deep in it. Remember, in ML, there is no one such algorithm which always gives best result. So, learn basic concept of every algorithm. And apply them to some real world data.</p>

<p>Now, the sources. Andrew Ng‚Äôs coursera course is a prefect place to start. The way he teaches ML concepts is very good for beginners. Also, his Stanford course is very good.</p>

<p>By doing these courses, you will at least have somewhat idea what ML is all about, and how things work. That‚Äôs what our goal was!! Congrats, if you have reached this far.</p>
