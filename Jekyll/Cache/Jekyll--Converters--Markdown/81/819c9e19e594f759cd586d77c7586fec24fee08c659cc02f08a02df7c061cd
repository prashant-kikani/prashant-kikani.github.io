I"H<p>This little post is about what I have learned from my 7 month ML journey. Hope a newbie like me found something to invest his/her 5 minutes in this.</p>

<p>About 7 months ago, I seriously started to focus in ML field. And right now, I have done many considerable good things. I have done projects like “<a href="https://github.com/prashant-kikani/toxic-comment-classifier">toxic-comment-classifier</a>”, “<a href="https://github.com/prashant-kikani/sarcasm-detector-by-CNN">sarcasm-detector</a>”, “<a href="https://github.com/prashant-kikani/movie-recommender">movie-recommender</a>” etc. And some “non-ML” projects like <a href="https://github.com/prashant-kikani/image-optimizer">image-optimizer</a> and an online gaming site to play Tic-Tac-Toe against unbeatable bot. Also I am an “<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/prashantkikani">expert</a>” in Kaggle kernels and doing summer Internship in Deep learning in Bangalore, India.</p>

<p>I will divide this post in 3 parts.</p>
<ul>
  <li>How to start?</li>
  <li>How to grow?</li>
  <li>How to maintain?</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="how-to-start">How to start?</h1>

<p>This question is very common in almost all of the aspirants. One basic analogy is, one needs to have at least basic knowledge of statistics, calculus (specially for Deep Learning) and linear algebra to understand concepts of Machine Learning &amp; Deep Learning. Remember I have said “basic”. You don’t need to be expert in it. And if you have done high school studies good, you most probably have it. So, congrats. You already have base of ML!!</p>
