I"«<p>In this post, I share my ideas to live a happy life by following some simple, realistic &amp; statistically valid ways.</p>

<h1 id="the-uncomfortable-truth">The Uncomfortable Truth</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>One day, you and everyone you love will die. And beyond a small group of people for an extremely brief period of time, 
little of what you say or do will ever matter. This is the Uncomfortable Truth of life. 
And everything you think or do is but an elaborate avoidance of it. 
We are inconsequential cosmic dust, bumping and milling about on a tiny blue speck. We imagine our own importance. 
<mark>We invent our purpose</mark> ‚Äî we are nothing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So what? Should we all give up whatever we are doing as nothing matters anyway? Surely NO.</p>

<p>This leads to the idea of <a href="https://www.becomingminimalist.com/what-is-minimalism/">minimalism</a>. We‚Äôll discuss that in a while.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h1 id="why-our-generation-is-so-stressed--unhappy">Why our generation is so stressed &amp; unhappy?</h1>

<p>Because of modern technology &amp; social media, we have became habitual of instant gratification. We give damn about almost everything that is not in our control. Therefor we tie our happiness with stuff which we can‚Äôt control.</p>

<p>For example, People care about who wins IPL, how many followers their friends have, why people don‚Äôt reply instantly on WhatsApp, why people love/hate Modi etc. We can‚Äôt control these things.</p>

<p>Does that mean we shouldn‚Äôt care about anything? Become a saint? Again, surely NO. Then what should we do?</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h1 id="solution-10">Solution 1.0</h1>

<p>Solution is simple. Give your damn to only 4‚Äì5 things. Like your goals, career, family &amp; very close friends, your idols. That‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs that simple. Why you need to care about other things when you have limited amount of days to live?</p>

<p>In other words, only care about things which you can control.</p>

<p>That does not mean to be cruel to other people/thing you don‚Äôt care about. Be kind; but up to a certain limit.</p>

<p>If you do this, you &amp; only you have your key to happiness. As your future lies in your hands. If you do well, you achieve your goals, become happy. If you don‚Äôt do well, you fail, you try again with different approach.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h1 id="a-trap">A trap</h1>

<p>Does that mean, once you achieve a goal you become happy? No.</p>

<p>You become more eager to achieve the next one. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with expecting more. But it‚Äôs an endless loop. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/travel/top-10-secrets-casinos-dont-want-you-to-know">Casinos</a> in Las Vegas run on this simple human behavior.</p>

<p>So, what‚Äôs the solution now?</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h1 id="satisfaction">Satisfaction</h1>

<p>You need to be satisfied with what you have.</p>

<p>Now does that mean we should never expect more? In that way, humanity will never achieve higher standards. No.</p>

<p>The thing is, we attach our selves &amp; our own happiness with that expectation (or goals). If we fail to achieve that for some reason, we‚Äôll again feel sad no matter how much we have already. We are giving our key to happiness to something else. So, what to do now?</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h1 id="solution-20">Solution 2.0</h1>

<p>So, with what we should attach our happiness? The process. That‚Äôs the only thing we can control. Achieving that goal also have other factors which you can‚Äôt control.</p>

<p>Almost all things (or your goals) follow this simple realistic fact.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Outcome = Result of ( Things you can control + Things you can‚Äôt control )
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That outcome can be anything. Your goal or something else.</p>

<p>For example, you want to reach to bus station on time. Thing you can control is, leaving 20 minutes earlier from home. Things you can‚Äôt control are puncture in car, huge traffic jam etc.</p>

<p>If you attach your happiness with LHS of the equation, you may or may not be happy as there are factors you can‚Äôt control. But if you attach happiness with 1st part of RHS, you‚Äôll always be happy as only you control it. You gave your 100% or not? If yes, then no worries. If no, try again next time.</p>

<p>Idea of minimalism also works here. Steve Jobs have applied this in his life successfully.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h1 id="one-more-thing">One more thing</h1>

<p>Don‚Äôt lie to yourself. Don‚Äôt pretend that, I always give my best then also I almost never achieve my goals.</p>

<p>Statistically speaking, if you gave your best in 10 shots and only 1‚Äì2 worked out, there‚Äôs high probability that something wrong is going on with so called ‚Äúyour best‚Äù. Assuming things you can‚Äôt control (i.e. 2nd part of the equation), follow the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">normal distribution</a>, theoretically, your success rate should be more than 49% if you always gave your best.</p>

<p>Be realistic. No one is perfect. You need to constantly improve yourself by learning more &amp; more till your last breath. Almost no one can achieve goals (and become ‚Äúhappy‚Äù) in short time. Exceptions are always there. But ignoring those outliers, you need to do a lot of practice to become master at something.</p>

<p>Real world don‚Äôt give instant gratification as modern technology &amp; social media give.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h1 id="a-thought-on-comparison">A thought on Comparison</h1>

<p>People say, don‚Äôt compare yourself with others, you‚Äôll end up sad. That‚Äôs not true. Comparison is not bad. Unhealthy comparison is bad.</p>

<p>Messi is getting better everyday because of Ronaldo; Ronaldo is getting better everyday because of Messi. Same is true for Google &amp; Microsoft, Pepsi &amp; Coca-cola, Adidas &amp; Nike. They do healthy comparison. If they can do it better why can‚Äôt we?</p>

<p>But they know the limit. They don‚Äôt attach themselves with outcome. If they do, they will burn out soon. They accept the result &amp; learn from it. So, do healthy comparison if want to get better in long term. Healthy comparison is a win-win condition. Both party get better.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h1 id="the-solution">The solution</h1>

<p>To be happy in long term,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Give your damns to things only you can control &amp; don‚Äôt lie to yourself. Be realistic &amp; optimistic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>FYI, If you have food, cloths &amp; a home to live, you are already far more happier than billions of people in the world. Think this way.</p>

<p>Since the evolution of mankind, 100 billion human beings have walked the Earth. If you are reading this, you are likely in the top 1% by any measure: opportunity, security, happiness. In fact, you might be in the top 0.1% or even 0.01%. What an amazing opportunity. You‚Äôre truly among the blessed.</p>

<p>Happiness is all that matters at the end of the day. Have a happy life.</p>

<p>üëè üëè You made it till the end ! Congrats.</p>
