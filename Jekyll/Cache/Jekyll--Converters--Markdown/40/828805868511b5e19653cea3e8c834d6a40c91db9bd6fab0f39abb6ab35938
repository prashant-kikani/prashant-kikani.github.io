I"<p>This little post is about what I have learned from my 7 month ML journey. Hope a newbie like me found something to invest his/her 5 minutes in this.</p>

<p>About 7 months ago, I seriously started to focus in ML field. And right now, I have done many considerable good things. I have done projects like “<a href="https://github.com/prashant-kikani/toxic-comment-classifier">toxic-comment-classifier</a>”, “<a href="https://github.com/prashant-kikani/sarcasm-detector-by-CNN">sarcasm-detector</a>”, “movie-recommender” etc. And some “non-ML” projects like image-optimizer and an online gaming site to play Tic-Tac-Toe against unbeatable bot. Also I am an “expert” in Kaggle kernels and doing summer Internship in Deep learning in Bangalore, India.</p>
