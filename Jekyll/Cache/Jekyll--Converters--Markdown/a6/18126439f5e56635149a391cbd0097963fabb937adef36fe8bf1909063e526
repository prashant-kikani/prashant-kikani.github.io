I"–<p>This little post is about what I have learned from my 7 month ML journey. Hope a newbie like me found something to invest his/her 5 minutes in this.</p>

<p>About 7 months ago, I seriously started to focus in ML field. And right now, I have done many considerable good things. I have done projects like ‚Äú<a href="https://github.com/prashant-kikani/toxic-comment-classifier">toxic-comment-classifier</a>‚Äù, ‚Äú<a href="https://github.com/prashant-kikani/sarcasm-detector-by-CNN">sarcasm-detector</a>‚Äù, ‚Äú<a href="https://github.com/prashant-kikani/movie-recommender">movie-recommender</a>‚Äù etc. And some ‚Äúnon-ML‚Äù projects like <a href="https://github.com/prashant-kikani/image-optimizer">image-optimizer</a> and an online gaming site to play Tic-Tac-Toe against unbeatable bot. Also I am an ‚Äú<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/prashantkikani">expert</a>‚Äù in Kaggle kernels and doing summer Internship in Deep learning in Bangalore, India.</p>

<p>I will divide this post in 3 parts.</p>
<ul>
  <li>How to start?</li>
  <li>How to grow?</li>
  <li>How to maintain?</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="how-to-start">How to start?</h1>

<p>This question is very common in almost all of the aspirants. One basic analogy is, one needs to have at least basic knowledge of statistics, calculus (specially for Deep Learning) and linear algebra to understand concepts of Machine Learning &amp; Deep Learning. Remember I have said ‚Äúbasic‚Äù. You don‚Äôt need to be expert in it. And if you have done high school studies good, you most probably have it. So, congrats. You already have base of ML!!</p>

<p>While starting, remember on thing. Learn in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search">BFS</a> manner, not in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search">DFS</a> manner. What I want to say is, try to grasp overall idea of each and every concept of ML. Don‚Äôt just pick one algorithm and do very deep in it. Remember, in ML, there is no one such algorithm which always gives best result. So, learn basic concept of every algorithm. And apply them to some real world data.</p>

<p>Now, the sources. <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning">Andrew Ng‚Äôs coursera course</a> is a prefect place to start. The way he teaches ML concepts is very good for beginners. Also, his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=A89DCFA6ADACE599">Stanford course</a> is very good.</p>

<p>By doing these courses, you will at least have somewhat idea what ML is all about, and <b>how things work</b>. That‚Äôs what our goal was!! Congrats, if you have reached this far.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h1 id="how-to-grow">How to grow?</h1>

<p>There are 2 main ways to grow your knowledge in ML. Projects &amp; Competitions.</p>

<p>Try to build something which includes some algorithm which you have just learned. It‚Äôs not compulsory to select some high level cutting edge project definition. You can even choose to use simplest linear regression in your project. Aim is to implement it and build some real world use case. While building them, you will face many issues. But that‚Äôs perfectly okay!! Find some fix as per your understanding. And move on.</p>

<p>Second way is Competitions. <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a> is one of the biggest data science community. Take part in running competitions and learn as much as you can. Platforms like <a href="https://www.kdnuggets.com/">KDnuggets</a>, <a href="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/">Analytics Vidhya</a> are also good.</p>

<p>Its completely okay if your rank is low in these competitions. Your aim is not to win millions of dollars by winning these competitions, your aim is to learn something. RANKS REALLY DOESN‚ÄôT MATTER. You know, in these ML competitions, 1st rank will have let say 0.98598 accuracy and person at 500th rank will have 0.97198 accuracy. Rank difference is very high. But score is nearly same.</p>

<p>Read and try to understand other people‚Äôs view on the same problem by <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/kernels">Kaggle kernels</a>. Many working professional data scientists share their point of view by kernels. That is the best and fastest way to capture important things. They have experience and knowledge. See how they think and grow your thinking process that way.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h1 id="how-to-maintain">How to maintain?</h1>

<p>This is very important. ML is a vast ocean. Even some great researchers doesn‚Äôt know <b>all the concepts fully</b>. And you actually don‚Äôt need to digest all concepts. And even one knows all the concepts fully, his/her knowledge will not ‚Äúfull‚Äù after a week or two. <mark>Because in ML, every week something new comes</mark>.</p>

<p>Keep updated yourself by reading <a href="http://www.arxiv-sanity.com/">latest research papers</a>. Reading research papers is an art. You need to read them at least 2‚Äì3 times to grasp the very core of it. Try to understand what it is saying. Avoid mathematical formulas at first, if you find it cumbersome. Just grasp the idea. Learn these concepts and apply it in projects and competitions. You can keep up to date yourself in the cutting edge data science research by referring the publications from top tier conferences such as <a href="https://icml.cc/">ICML</a>, and reading blogs such as ‚Äú<a href="https://jack-clark.net/">Import AI</a>‚Äù.</p>

<p>If you don‚Äôt know how to know all the things about these top conferences, <a href="http://www.guide2research.com/topconf/machine-learning">here</a> is the best source to know more about each upcoming event in ML.</p>

<p>Doing ML alone can resist your growth. Because you never know what this concept can be viewed this way also. Here comes meet ups and tech-talks. PyData is one of them. PyData arranges various events and meet ups around the world. Join them if you can. You will definitely learn something new. PyCon is also good (specially for those who prefer Python as their working language. Which many of use do). Watch some success stories like this &amp; this to encourage your self learning!!</p>
