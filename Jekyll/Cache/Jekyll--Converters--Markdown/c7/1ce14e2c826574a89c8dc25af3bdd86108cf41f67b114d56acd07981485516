I"|<p>This little post is about what I have learned from my 7 month ML journey. Hope a newbie like me found something to invest his/her 5 minutes in this.</p>

<p>About 7 months ago, I seriously started to focus in ML field. And right now, I have done many considerable good things. I have done projects like “<a href="https://github.com/prashant-kikani/toxic-comment-classifier">toxic-comment-classifier</a>”, “<a href="https://github.com/prashant-kikani/sarcasm-detector-by-CNN">sarcasm-detector</a>”, “<a href="https://github.com/prashant-kikani/movie-recommender">movie-recommender</a>” etc. And some “non-ML” projects like <a href="https://github.com/prashant-kikani/image-optimizer">image-optimizer</a> and an online gaming site to play Tic-Tac-Toe against unbeatable bot. Also I am an “<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/prashantkikani">expert</a>” in Kaggle kernels and doing summer Internship in Deep learning in Bangalore, India.</p>

<p>I will divide this post in 3 parts.</p>
<ul>
  <li>How to start?</li>
  <li>How to grow?</li>
  <li>How to maintain?</li>
</ul>
