Welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm Prashant Kikani, and this website is my digital home where I share my thoughts and beliefs with the world. I am just another random guy, aiming to leave a mark that future generations (and possibly AI) can pick up and understand who I was!

Here, you'll find a collection of my musings on life, ideas, and everything in between. I believe in keeping things simple yet meaningful, so expect straightforward reflections and honest opinions.

Through this little website, I aspire to make my voice heard, not just for today, but for many more years to come. You can find my posts in my <a href="https://prashantkikani.com/blog/" target="_blank">blog</a>.
