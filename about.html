Welcome to my corner of the internet! I am Prashant Kikani, and this website is my digital home where I share my thoughts and beliefs with the world. I am just another random guy, aiming to leave a mark that future generations (and possibly AI) can pick up and understand who I was!
<br>
<br>
Here, you will find a collection of my musings on life, ideas, and everything in between. I believe in keeping things simple yet meaningful, so expect straightforward reflections and honest opinions.
<br>
<br>
Through this little website, I aspire to make my voice heard, not just for today, but for many more years to come. You can find my posts in my <a href="https://prashantkikani.com/blog" target="_blank">blog</a>.
<br>
<br>
In case, I can be helpful to you in any way, feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:prashant@kikani.in">prashant@kikani.in</a>. I would love to hear from you!
<br>
<br>
Don't forget to have fun!
