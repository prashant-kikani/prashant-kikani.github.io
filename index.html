		<p>Hi! My name is Prashant Kikani.</p>

		<p>I am currently a "Data Science Intern" at Reliance Jio, AI CoE.</p>
		
		<p>I like solving real world problems using Machine Learning & AI. I strongly believe AI is the future & my goal is to make +ve impact on millions of people's daily life with my abilities in Data Science & Machine Learning.</p>
		
		<p>I am also active on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/prashantkikani">Kaggle</a>. Which is world's largest Data Science Community. I take part in different Data Science Competitions to learn efficient techniques. I have achieved good ranks in <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/prashantkikani/competitions">some</a> of them. Also I have achieved "<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/prashantkikani/kernels">Master</a>" title in Kernels.</p>
		
		<p>I have made some Machine Learning projects while I was in college. All of them are on my <a href="https://github.com/prashant-kikani">GitHub</a>. Some of them are, <a href="https://github.com/prashant-kikani/toxic-comment-classifier">Toxic Comment Classifier</a>, <a href="https://github.com/prashant-kikani/image-optimizer">Image Optimizer</a>, play <a href="https://teddyletsplay.000webhostapp.com/">Tic-Tac-Toe</a> against unbeatable bot.</p>

		<p>Writing is my part time hobby. I like to write sci-fi stories. "<a href="https://teddyletsplay.000webhostapp.com/INTO_THE_UNKNOWN.pdf">Into the Unknown</a>" is one of them. Also I have written a <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/what-i-learned-from-7-month-ml-journey-955b0c0ca66b">blog</a> about my journey & experience in Machine Learning a year ago.</p>
