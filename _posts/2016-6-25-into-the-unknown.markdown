description: "A Sci-Fi story on alien life of another universe meeting Humans on earth."
---

This is a sci-fi story which I wrote in my broken naive English, back in summer holidays of 2016, inspired from my favorite sci-fi movies like Harry Potter, Star Wars, The Avengers, Prometheus & Arrival. Enjoy!


# Chapter 1: Flying Fish

The story starts from a planet called “Typhon”, lying somewhere in another Universe. This galaxy was near to a White hole compared to Earth. (After billions of years, Black hole is converted into White hole that emits Energy continuously.)

People of that planet are unlike from Humankind. They can get food or energy from their sun called “Tipo” if they want. Tipo is a White hole. This universe came into existence around 14.3 billion years ago(compared to 13.8 billion years of our universe). 

Population of this planet is very low compared to our Earth. They take sulfur as their living gas. As Humans take Oxygen. They can also take Selenium or Tellurium. They need a very low amount of these gases and can live till a long time of shortage of it. Gravity of Typhon is half as compared to Earth.

By chance they have the same time units as us. Like the year is “Yore”, the month is “Minz”. Day is “Dye”, hour is “Hore”. Rate of Time of that galaxy is very much slow as compared to our galaxy, nearly like:  their 1 Hour (1 Hore) is our 1 day.

They have their own language calls “Pamula”. Pamula is like our English language. They are far more away from our Technology age. They can understand all languages of any type of living creature. They have a converter, which translates that unknown language to their known language “Pamula”. 

They have four different types of peoples, called “Nithon”, “Astin”, “Quona” and “Zabuta”. Let’s understand their levels and works in their society.

Nithon are their Kings. They are like Lords of that planet. Astin type peoples invent new things. Quona type peoples do farming type works, and Zabuta type peoples are fighters of that planet. Zabuta had saved that planet many times from attackers of other planets or other Universes.

Lets overview their Lords, Nithon. Nithon or Lords have their weapons for their safety, called “weNithon”. All Nithons have this weapon. Astins make this weapon such that only it’s true owner can use this weapon, others can’t. If any new son born from Lord’s wife Astins creates a new weNithon for him.  They always wear a locket on their neck. Something like this…


<center><img src="../assets/into_the_unknown_i1.png"/></center>  
<br/>

In this locket, Triangle is for safety, Vertical line is for weNithon, and Circle is for new Inventions.

Story begins when a son of Nithon takes his first breath on Typhon. They give their name to the new little Nithon as “Hikon”. Older Nithons provide a tutor named “Inize” to little Hikon.

Hikon becomes smarter & stronger everyday with the help of Inize. Inize was from Neptune-(A planet of solar system or Universe in which Earth is Member. )

After long time, Hikon is now 17 years old. He knows all arts of fighting & managing kingdoms. Now he is able to manage his father’s kingdom called “Xappa”. At the age of 21 he will able to manage kingdom by law. 

Once Hikon sat with his teacher Inize. Inize was teaching about other galaxies. (Here are some conversations in English.) Suddenly Hikon asks him “What is your galaxy?” But Inize was not able to tell the true answer to him because Nithons bane him to tell anything about his solar system. But he told him the true answer. 

Hikon sees his way to answer. He doubts that there is any resistance to tell the true answer to him. Hikon asks “Inize, now we are more than a teacher-student relationship. We are now friends. So, tell me, why were you hesitating while giving an answer?” 

After some time Inize tell him “Long time ago a war happens b/w us and persons from my solar system….” Hikon stops him “No, peoples of your planet can not war with us. Because they are far behind us in Technology. Surely there are other creatures that fight with us... ” Inize nodded and said “Yes, you are right, my friend. They are Humankind. Creatures from Earth. Earth is another planet from my solar system.”

Hikon asks him “Is there any strange fact about that war? Because there are many wars that our Zabuta persons fight with others”.

Inize said “This is the only war in which our Zabuta loses in our whole History.” Hikon very surprisingly asked “Zabuta? And lose? Can Zabuta be defeated by others? Surely there is some mistake from you.” Inize told “No, my dear, this is bitter truth. Zabuta have only one lose in their history. Against Humankind..” Hikon stops him and said “But how..? How Zabuta can be defeated by others? 

They have very advanced weapons developed by Astins. Is Zabuta not bring his weapons in that war?!!” Inize says “No, they bring. But insidious Humankind break the rules of wars developed by Committee of War. These rules is same & constant for living creature, whether it belongs to any galaxy. ”

Hikon decided to go to the Earth. Anyway he successfully persuades Inize to go with him.  

Hikon went to Earth with Inize to see how creatures of Earth live. After viewing a picture of Earth from a distance, Hikon felt very excited. His tool called “Tiona” told him about Earth. Taking steps was difficult for them because they were used to their Gravity. But somehow they managed it. Hikon feels very strange by viewing Humans locality & their Democracy system. Hikon liked Earth very much after viewing the nature & system of Earth. He could not trust that creatures of this planet break the rules of war & win against us.

After some time now, Hikon & Inize feel hunger. So, they have to charge their body with something. Because they can’t charge their bodies with our Sun. So, they stop their journey near Africa forest. They saw our creatures like Elephant, Lion, Dear….After viewing Elephant Hikon said “This creature is like our “Zabuki”, second most found creature on our Typhon!” Hikon & Inize were very happy. They fed themselves by the roots of trees.   Hikon saw a Rabbit. He really liked it. He gave some food to it. Hikon & Inize play some time with it. Hikon really wanted to take it to their planet Typhon. They were reverted around Africa forest. But their bad luck that one of our humans saw them, & starts yelling after viewing these two aliens. In a few minutes these two strange creatures were surrounded by humans(They were local peoples of the forest).

Both are now scared. Humans started to attack on them with rocks & sticks. They can’t go to their Typhon, without a tool called “Oppe”, which was lost by Hikon a few hours ago, when a big storm came.

Hikon created a shield using weNithon. So, both now feel safe. One intelligent human called the department of forest. But for some reason the team of rescue was not available. But one of the officers of the forest department calls an American spy agency located at Cape Town, at the foreign department of Africa.

Here at the Typhon, Hikon’s mother did not see her son till 1:30 Hore. So, she told her husband, the lord of that kingdom, about this.

After some hours, the agency came & saw these two strange creatures. Agency was sure that these two are not from their planet. They rapidly take a valuable decision for them.  And call the American Government about these two creatures (Aliens). Hikon spend that night anyway against them though he & Inize feel hunger very much.

Next day, a big team came from Pentagon (famous U. S. Defense unit) at that place. By, viewing many humans staring at him Hikon feel very unsafe, & he again started use of weNithon. He made some people blind with help of it. Inize can’t do anything. In answer, humans also attack on them, but with the help of shield, Hikon & Inize save their lives. Hikon also attack on them by weNithon & kill two humans. So, team members also attack on them very strongly but they can’t hurt them, till Hikon has weNithon. So, team members stop attack.

At night Hikon & Inize have to take some rest & charge their body. So, Hikon removed shield, & take rest. And Inize went for food. Also by the rules of war no one can attack during night. But because of tiredness, Hikon forgot that Humans not obey any rules. One of the team member show that they removed shield. So, he quickly shot a beam of U.V. Rays on them which contains very high energy. That makes Hikon lame. He run towards them and grab the weapon (weNithon) & Hikon. But he can’t use it. Because it can be used only by its true owner.

Now team members caught them. When Inize returned, human also caught him. Here, at Typhon, Hikon‘s father have sure suspect that Hikon was surely in that solar system in which Neptune is group member. Because Hikon’s mother saw Hikon with Inize, when she saw Hikon last time.  So, he took his weNithon & 7 Zabuta persons with him, & went towards his son, who is presently on Earth. Because now Hikon was missing for 2 hores (our 2 days). 

After few hours, with help of their latest technological instruments he found his son. He saw his son. He understood the situation & attacks on team members by his weNithon. One of team members call Pentagon to give some “Flying Fishes” to them. Pentagon gave them the thing that they want. Officers of Pentagon make alive some of “Flying Fishes”, which were kept at the deep of African sea, to attack on aliens. Flying Fish is like our Airplanes, but it can start flying from the water & can stop their journey on the water.

Next day arrived, defense team starts attack on the aliens again. But all tries failed against Hikon’s father’s weNithon. So, anyhow they take aliens at the sea shore, so that they can use “Flying Fish” against them. 

After reaching at desired place, Main commander ordered that “Attack, Flying Fishes….” Hikon’s father heard the word “Flying Fish”. With the help of converter he can know the meaning of the beautiful word! He really likes the word!! He said “What a word…Flying Fish!”. Hikon’s father like the new Flying Fishes, because they have same shape as their weapon called “Jippa”. But he have to make it disable because it were against himself. Hikon’s father very clearly made them disable after some tries. As he liked them he did not broke it, only he make some “short circuits” to disable them.

Hikon’s father & Zabuta peoples know the nature of Humans as they have past experience. So, they fight against them very carefully & strongly.

At the evening Hikon’s father successfully make disable all instruments of humans, and saved the precious life of both, Hikon & Inize. Hikon’s father has “Oppe”. So, they all successfully reached Typhon.

Hikon & Inize apologized their lord for their mistake. And Lord (Hikon’s father) forgives them. But Hikon was still eager to know more about Humankind. He decided that after he will become Lord of his father’s kingdom called “Xappa”, he will surely go to the Earth again to know more about Humans & meet that cute rabbit!


<br/>

# Chapter 2: Barking Ball

Now, Hikon is of 21 yores(their year). And now he is able to become the Lord of Xappa. His father said him in their language that “My dear, now I put a great Responsibility on your shoulders. You have to protect this kingdom & this planet till your last breathes. ” Hikon take vow that his father asked him and now he became the lord of that country.

After some days his desire to go the Earth becomes stronger. Hikon ordered Astins to make a tool that can communicate them with Humans. After some dyes(their day) Astins invented that tool named “Katapi”. Previous tool was only able to understand what human talks. But now they can communicate.    Everything was going right in his country. So, he thought that that was the best time to go for Earth. Meet that little rabbit! 

He and his one of the best friend named “Somin” make a plan to go to the Earth. Somin was from Quona type persons. 

At the decided dye (their day) they started their Journey. After few hours, via "Warm Hole", they came to the Earth. Somin also liked the view of Earth from distance. Hikon feel strange by viewing the view of Earth at distance. Because it was not that Earth view what he saw before 4 yores. Hikon confirmed that it was surely Earth or not, by his Tiona tool. He thought that Let see what happens to his dear Earth. 

After reaching Earth, Hikon saw that that was completely different Earth which he saw before 4 yores. After few hours he was able to know that problems named “Pollution” and “Global Warming” causes that harm of view. He analyze that peoples of Earth called Humans are also different. He thought that above two problems also harms the Humans also. He was right. 

He tried to found that rabbit but he got failure every time. He saw Humans crying on the road. Now Hikon decided to bring Earth the view which he saw before 4 yores. So, by his tools, and very much help of his Quona friend Somin he lowered percentage of Carbon Dioxide. Because he found this named gas causes these major problems.

In few days Earth became as clean as he saw before. He and Somin were very happy after viewing a completely new picture of Earth. Scientists of Earth feel very surprise about this happening. He fools normal peoples or normal Humans that a Comet came & brings CO2 with it. Human also believed them too!!

Now Hikon and Somin started their journey. They start from Afghanistan. And travel towards east. After visiting Arab countries and Pakistan they came to India. 

First part they saw of India was Gujarat. He got continually information from his tool -Tiona. One thing that really amazed them is India’s population. They fell that in this kind of environment how these Humans are alive? So, they decided to stay some days in Gujarat.

They stay in Gujarat in uniform of soldier, because Hikon knew that if these Humans will see in their dress, They will scare & may happen a second war b/w them. Also, soldier dress covers all parts of body. So, Humans can’t see his body parts too.

They stay their first night of India in white desert of Kutch. Now, they has not problem of food. Because Astins had invented a technique of “Teleport”. So, peoples from Typhon regularly send food to their Lord.  

Next morning, they start their journey. First people they meet of Gujarat were a saint. He ware orange cloths. Now they were able to talk with Human by help of Katapi. First word they talk with any Human was “God”. Because they met saint as their first Human.

Hikon hear this “God” word many time. So, he thought that the concept of God was very deep in India. He was eager to know about God. Translator gave word “Lord” to similar word of “God”, when Hikon asked it. Now Hikon was able to understand he was one of the God of their planet –Typhon!. 

They met many type of peoples in Gujarat. Peoples gave them honor as they were in the dress of Soldier. 

Once they saw a lying people on a layer of wood & cotton. Humans around him were crying very loudly. He found after some time that that person was dead. Hikon feel very very strange. He really not understood Why humans are dead? Is there not any tool or factor that prevent death from Humans? Because on Typhon, people can die only after his or her own desire. Noone can take his or her life.

Hikon was still don't understand the "Concept of Death". Hikon thought that Originate of Humans can give answers of all Questions. Because of Humans also don't know about their Originate he ordered the Astins to find the Originate of Humans & told them to give answer in 1/2 dyes (their days). So, Now Hikon have to wait 12 days of Earth to get answer. Because time of Earth was faster than Typhon. 

Next day, Hikon meet a Student from a well known College. His name was “Parth”. He was very sad. At first student scars from those two soldiers. But after he managed it. Hikon asks him the reason of his being sad. Student answered “Today I fail in my last year final Exam. I really don’t want to study in this Education system...”  Parth was studding Medical stream. Hikon give sympathy to him & talk with him for hours. 

Parth was living with an engineer at his room. Two bed was empty. So, he gave place to these two soldiers in his room. Now they became “Room mates”. After some days Hikon asked Parth about his reality. Parth was very scared & feel strange but after Hikon’s sympathy he became a true friend of the creature of Typhon.   

They usually play with a Ball, which sounds like dogs barking when it hits to something. Parth call this ball as “Barking Ball”. Hikon & Somin liked word “Barking Ball” very much, and the playing with it too.

Parth usually started to talk about the faulty Education System of India and Gujarat. Hikon was wanted to remove this faulty Education System but he can’t.

Hikon send Information about “Hindu Sanskriti” with the help of Parth to the Astins. Astins are now able to continue their research about Originate of Humans.

Now, they have to leave Gujarat. Because they want to visit more parts of India.

Parth give warm sent to both of them from Gujarat. Hikon & Somin left Gujarat. Now they are in Maharashtra, and they continue their journey.

<br/>

# Chapter 3: Into the Unknown

Hikon and Gubin are in Maharashtra. They visited Bombay. They liked the persons of Bombay, as they work 14 to 15 in a day. They felt like in Bombay, persons never sleep. As in night you surely feel like a day. At last they left Maharashtra.

(After visiting south region of India.) They go towards East. Peoples of East are poor compared to West. Hikon feel strange that one part of country is wealthy and other is poor? Isn’t that’s a fault of Kings of India (Indian Government)?

Then they go towards North. He visited Delhi, Ayodhya, Kashmir, Haryana….Hikon took bath in the holy rivers “Ganga” & “Yamuna”.

They get many experiences of different kinds. They feel very much excitement in their whole journey. They meet many persons in their whole journey.  But no one was as good as a “Gujarati”. So, Hikon was very eager to meet again Parth.

After they reach Gujarat, Hikon meet Parth. Both were very happy, as both of them met each other after about two years. 

Parth then introduced his two new friends named “Simahi” & “Gubin”. Parth doesn’t know the truth behind these two. But Hikon knows.

Simahi is from planet “Hipaza”.  The group which she belongs was known for their bad thoughts and cruel mentality. She is from “Bithions”. And Gubin is from Neptune, same planet from which Inize belongs. 

Simahi was a poor laborer of Hipaza. She knows English very well. She was like same age of Hikon. But she was very intelligent. She can do whatever she wants. Hikon was searching such kind of lady, who can beat a man. So, he was interested in Simahi. Creatures of Hipaza were very insidious. But Simahi was not one of them by mentality. She likes Digital world of Earth. She likes Hacking, Artificial Intelligence and other Technological things of Earth. So, she came to Earth.

Gubin was from Neptune. Neptune is far behind in Technology as compared to Typhon, Hipaza and Earth. So, he was like a small kid among Parth, Hikon and Simahi.         

They spent some days with each other. All of them know about History and Technologies of planets of each other. Hikon and Somin (his Quona friend) were very happy as they both like to know about “Extra Terrestrials (ETs)”.

Hikon received a massage as a king from Typhon, he knew about a small attack of Bithions on Typhon. Zabutas killed all Bithions on Typhon. Simahi also received a message from his mother about the same thing. So, both of them have to go to their mother land. Gubin also went to Neptune. So, now Parth was friendless!!

After reaching Typhon via Warm hole, Hikon knew that 61 of Zabutas were seriously injured. But they killed 143 Bithions. So, Hikon gave honor to all of them. Hikon was very serious about this attack. At first he suspects that is their all about Simahi’s betrays? But after some time he removed that suspect, as Simahi was very clean by Heart.

Hikon order all Astins to stop their all researches and only work on this attack. Astins invented more Advanced Technological & effective weapons. Astins also invent that they can take shelter in the Black hole. As they invented a way to come out from Black hole. Now, Hikon’s gang can move their whole planet anywhere. As we can move our vehicles as per our desire. So, they can move Typhon into the Black hole & can come out too.

Here on Hipaza, Simahi was trying to stop the war b/w Typhon & Hipaza. But she was poor enough to be ignored by others. So, all tries of Simahi got failure. King of Hipaza called “Fiziki” was very insidious. His dream was that he will be able to win all the planets where life takes breath, and become a Great King of History.

The war b/w Typhon & Hipaza was about to rise…..

Hikon knows that he can’t defeat Fiziki by only his army; Hikon must get help of other ETs to get win over Fiziki. So, he started to find the helping hand. First he asked Parth to get help from Earth.

Parth went to US and told the whole story to the American ET organization. As his uncle was in US government. He helped Parth a lot. Firstly they don’t believe Parth, but Parth shows them accurate proofs of Hikon & Simahi. Officers of the Organization thought that if they took part in this, they can know more about technological instruments of ETs. And they can take a high jump in ladder of Technological age. After all, war is all about Typhon & Hipaza. So, Earth isn’t in danger. So, Humankind was about to become a helping hand of Typhon. 

So, now there are two groups, in one Typhon and Earth and in other Hipaza and his friend planets. Friend of Hipaza was not so, strong as Earth. So, Hikon request to Humans that they have to fight against friend planets of Hipaza. And he will fight against Hipaza itself.

Astins now able to know about the “Three masteries stones”. These three are unique in the whole Milky Way. The group which have these three stones or one or two of them, can beat anyone who don’t have the stones.

Astins show the pictures and details of these three stones to Hikon.                          

First stone is  “Green-king” second is “Blackabon” and third is “Blueish”.  These are three uniqe elements of the milky way.

<center><img src="../assets/into_the_unknown_i2.png"/></center>  
<br/>

Green-king is poisonus stone. It can kill the whole army with the help of his very dangeorus Poison. Noone can break this poison with the help of any medicine or any other things.

Blackabon can create very big thunder strom that can swallow a small planet too. It can create “perfect” 0 kelvin temprarure(-273.15 degree celsius) in very big area. 

Third is Blueish. It can create big amount of heat. It can melt a great amount of anything at same time. It can create a temprature of degree 1010 Kelvin (in Human’s notation). But can’t melt Blackabon & Green-king. Its only weakness is this.

Astins find Blueish on Uranus(neighbour of Neptune). Fiziki find out Green-king from other Terrertrials. But noone could find out Blackabon. “Where is Blackabon?” Is a big mystery.

Now, both parties are ready. Fiziki is in attacking mood. & Hikon is in Defencive mood. & Humans are in mood of getting more knowledge..! Fiziki know all weakneeses of Hikon, and their community. Hikon provide a great amount of Technologiacal Instruments & weapons to Humans.

And the war begins…..

At first Humans attacks(as usual…!!) on enemies. Friends of Fiziki were week. So, Humans destoys them easyly with “Atom bomb” and other powerful weapons which Hikon provide, in few days. With the help of this, Humans know how they can travel to other galaxy via warm holes.

Here, Fiziki attacks on Typhon. As per the plan Fiziki first attack on Astins, as Astins are most important persons of Hikon. Astins make new weapons. But without them Zabutas have to fight with old weapons. Zabutas strongly defend a very strong attack of Fiziki on Astins…

Hikon was very good at war & other releted things with the help of his teacher “Inize”. So, at first he starts attack on army of Fiziki. Hikon always kept some Astins with him during war. Hikon got a spark, He order them to make a very strong weapon with a combination of his weNithon & Blueish. Astins soon make a combination of weNithon & Blueish. Now, Hikon is very powerful.
    
Soon, Fiziki killed all Astins with the help of Green-king. Zabutas tried against Fiziki but they can’t do anything against Green-king. Fiziki killed Astins, is like he cut the right hand of Hikon. Now Hikon have only few Astins, which are with him.

Here Hikon killed almost half army of Fiziki, with the help of a new weapon which is “weNithon + Blueish”. Fiziki now came to Hikon.

Now the real war begins b/w Hikon & Fiziki….

Fiziki attacked first (like Humans..!). Hikon defend him very clearly. Fiziki commit many attacks but only thing he got was Failure. 

Fiziki demotivate Hikon by telling him… “Now, you can’t protect your week children & grand children against me….I killed all the Astins…..Now, you can’t give new weNithons to your next generations…Hahaha….” Hikon was very shocked by hearing this. But things were not worst, because Hikon have some Astin couples with him. Fiziki didn’t know anything about this. If Hikon will not protect this Astin couples, his future will surely in danger. So, he ordered all Astins to go & find some shelter with Quonas.

Zabutas were fighting by heart, they didn’t have any fear of Death, as on Typhon any living creature can die only if he/she wants, but their magic can’t work against “Green-king”. So, Zabutas were dying continuously. 

Now, Hikon have to do something creative to defeat Fiziki. So, Hikon run towards Black hole. So, Fiziki also run towards Hikon. As, he want to kill him and won the Typhon.

Soon, Hikon reached a far away from war place. He ordered all Zabutas to come back. Zabutas understand Hikon’s massage and they follow. As Zabutas leave the war place, Hikon make a clear & clever use of the combined weapon. And melt the remained half army in a single spark of combo weapon. So, every single soldier of Fiziki was now dead. But almost all Zabutas remained alive.      

Fiziki also want to attack on Zabutas by Green-king, but Hikon was running very fast. So, he have to follow him, to kill him. Hikon knows that Fiziki will surely follow him. Hikon know that how can he come out from Black hole, but Fiziki doesn’t. 

In few hours Hikon reached near Black hole. He told Humans how anyone can come out from Black hole. So, few Humans also go with Hikon into the Black hole. Because Hikon need some protection against Fiziki. Because Zabutas were far behind them. 

Fiziki don’t know anything  about Black hole. Because there is no Astin type researchers on Hipaza planet. So, for him, going into the Black hole, is like going “Into the Unknown”. But he kept following Hikon, he kept following his Dream… and finally go into the Black hole. 

Now, Hikon, Fiziki and some Humans are in the Black hole. Hikon see Time as a Dimension in the Black hole. He can feel Time as we feel other Dimensions. There are more dimensions too. Humans invent “Morse Code”. In which only dash (-) and dot (.) is there.

Hikon knows that “Gravity” of the Black hole is so high that it bends the “Time.” So, via this Hikon can do anything with Time. But Hikon forget that his enemy, Fiziki also can anything with time. 

Hikon told Fiziki “Now, you are a prisoner of this Black hole. You can’t go out of it. But I can. So, live your life in this Multi dimensional World, A world with “No Ending” for a creature who doesn’t know how he/she can go out from it. So, goodbye Fiziki…!”.

Now Hikon was free. He thanked Humans for their support, by heart. Humans are now know the secrets of the Universe. Rate of time on Typhon is very slow as compared to Earth. So, those Humans who were with Hikon in Black hole now will see their grand children of the same age as they are on Earth.

That war remained for 213 years of Humans. But by this big sacrifice of that Humans who came from Black hole, can move forward the level of Technology of Earth so high that we can’t imagine…

Here, Fiziki got a spark that he has “Time” in his hand. So, he can do whatever he wants. He had “Green-king” too. 

Typhon was seriously damaged. Many of Zabutas were died. Almost all Astins are dead… But all Quona peoples and Nithons are alive. As Quona and Nithons were under the unbreakable protection of “Blueish”. Hikon order remained Astins to continue their research on “Originate of Humans”.

Now Humans create a good relationship b/w them and creatures of Typhon. With the help of Hikon, Humans can now get big steps in Technology. 

After some days Simahi comes to the Typhon, to meet the King of the land “Hikon”. They both memorize the past Golden memories. Simahi’s logical sentences impressed the king. And so, Hikon married with Simahi. As he like females who have capacity to defeat man in Brain Power. Now they decide to take Parth and Gubin on Typhon. 

So, they both start their journey, again towards the Earth. But this time, Together..!!                     

<br/>

## In upcoming chapters..

Hikon, Simahi and Gubin are on Earth.  Now they can travel through other milky ways too. After some time Astins found that Blackabon in other Milky Way. And start tries to capture it. 

Here Fiziki start to do something with time. So, as a result, peoples of Typhon start to become younger and younger (Time start to run in reverse direction). For Humans Time start to go faster. So, humans start to become older and older. Older Astins become younger. So, they invented that there is only one thing that control the “Time” is “Gravity”. 

So, if they can control gravity of Black Hole, they can stop it. But by which way they can get control on a very big amount of “Gravity” of Black Hole??...
