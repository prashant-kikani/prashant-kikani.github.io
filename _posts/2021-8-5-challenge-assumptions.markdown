Fundamental premise of science is to challenge assumptions. When we challenge the existing hypothesis or the existing thing which we hold to be true, we're engaging in science.

As the world is moving at an ever fast pace, sometimes what happens is the approach which was best to solve the problem 2 years ago is no longer the best, there are far better approaches to choose from. So, if we never question or challenge our existing beliefs and assumptions, chances are higher that they are outdated or simply not true anymore.

Oftentimes, we assume certain things unconsciously and build our hypothesis on top of that. And if those fundamental assumptions turn out to be false, our whole hypothesis also becomes false.

If we assume that what we know is wrong, then we will get a chance to question those assumptions and check if they are actually true, or if circumstances have changed and they are no longer true.  

This idea of challenging assumptions & <a href="https://prashantkikani.com/blog/adaptability" target="_blank">adaptability</a> also somewhat leads to the idea of thinking from first principles. Which says that, while <a href="https://prashantkikani.com/blog/solve-problems" target="_blank">solving a problem</a>, instead of thinking from our existing beliefs, think from the small fundamental hypothesis which is known to be true, and build up from there.

## Innovation

Almost every innovation starts from a noble pursuit of wonder. When we challenge existing beliefs and try to think from scratch, without almost any assumptions, chances are higher that we will find a better solution.

As I mentioned before, the world is progressing faster than ever, and because of that the best way to solve the problem keeps changing after some years. That's why we see so many disruptions in the businesses every now and then.

Companies who don't innovate themselves as the time goes, will get disrupted. New companies will emerge and outsmart them by providing better products and services. So, it's more crucial than ever to keep challenging assumptions!

Here's another similar post on the topic of "[The Next Big Technological Wave](https://prashantkikani.com/blog/next-wave)" which explores, which technologies can rule the next decade. We got almost everything we use like iPhone, Android, YouTube, Facebook, Spotify etc in the last 20 years. What can next 10-20 years can bring? Which technologies have potential to grow at exponential speed.
