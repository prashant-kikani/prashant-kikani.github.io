Freedom is perhaps the most important underrated thing in the world. On this day of independence, let's explore freedom.  

In today's world, we are free to pursue almost anything. We can pursue our dream of becoming astronaut, building large businesses, working at cool companies, learning anything from the internet, saying our opinions on social media. No one is stopping us pursue our dreams.                    

As most of us are living in a free world, we sometime take it for granted and don't realize how important freedom is. We can't imagine world without freedom. A world in which someone can control your destiny is a like a nightmare.  

One of the most important piece of freedom is financial freedom. Till we are dependent on someone else financially, we are not totally free.

# Financial Freedom

In laymen terms we can describe financial freedom as, the state of having enough income that satisfy your living expenses without depending on some single entity. 

We can also see financial freedom this way which is, it's about removing the income dependency from one or handful of entity. If you're running any kind of business, you may have hundreds or thousands of customers. If one of them leaves, you won't get affected much. So, your income is not dependent on a single entity, unlike jobs.

Goal of not depending on a single entity is, risk of your total income can go to zero in near future is higher than when you have multiple sources of income which are good enough to cover living expanses.     

When your income is not dependent on one single entity, it's unlikely that it'll become zero in a near future. Unlike job, where if employer wants to fire you, your income is gone. But if you've invested high enough amount from that job's income to equity markets, mutual/debt funds it'll keep growing & your living expanses will be covered.  

Debt also can be a big  problem for some people. We may take bad debts which does not yield enough returns to even cover the interest rates. There'a great saying about debt:

> There are two ways to conquer and enslave a country. One is by the sword. The other is by debt. -John Adams 

As of March 2021, India have US$ 570.0 billion of external debt. Which we need to pay someday in future. GDP to debt ratio of our country is also very high.

So I think till we did not achieve financial freedom, we're not really free. Someone can control us if they want if we are financially dependent on them.  

Capitalism also have played a big role in individual's freedom by providing proper economic incentives. Let's explore that a bit.

<br/>

# Capitalism 

In today's capitalist world, people are free to become so rich that their net worth will be larger than GDP of entire countries. Today anyone can become almost anything provided they have required skills. And <b>internet have democratised knowledge</b>. We can learn almost anything online freely and apply that knowledge in real world.     

Capitalism plays a very important role in our freedom. As people are economically incentivized to make better product and services that their other people love and are willing to pay for. So, entrepreneurs and businessmen will make products and services which solve other people's problems. And because there's competition in the market, we are free to choose anyone we like.

What if Steve Jobs was not free to make Apple computers and iPhone? We will not have those products. What if Larry Page and Sergey Brin were controlled by someone else and they were not free to make something which can democratised the knowledge? We will not have Google. 

All these imaginations sounds a bit weird but it is possible. Many developing countries including India were controlled by British people for many decades. People of these countries were not totally free.

But capitalism provided high economic incentives businessmen and entrepreneurs of those developing countries like India to build product and services which were solving people's problems. And using those products and services, people of developing countries became better and better, enough to start their own businesses and repeat the cycle again.

Jio is a great example for this. Mukesh Ambani made his fortune from oil and gas industries and invested that money to create Jio. Which lowered the internet data prices so low that almost everyone can afford to use internet. Because of Jio, internet became a comodity. 

Millions of people came online because of very low prices of internet plans. And because of that, startups like Paytm, Ola, Swiggy, Zomato, OYO, BigBasket got customer base of millions.
