> "We have two lives, and the second one begins when we realize we only have one." -Confucius

> "The only true wisdom is in knowing, you know nothing." -Socrates

Understanding that these is so much out there to explore & learn about life, psychology and this universe & what I currently know is nothing against it, is the true wisdom.

> "You have to dream before your dreams can come true." -A.P.J. Abdul Kalam

> "Education is not the learning of facts, but the training of mind to think." -Albert Einstein

In the age of computers, learning of "facts" is not valuable. But, how to think, how to approach & solve any problem is more important.

A small misunderstanding can break relations. But it takes consistent & quality efforts to maintain the relationship.

> "When everyone is sick, we no longer consider it a disease." -Naval

This sounds kind of obvious but think about it, if <b>anything</b> is common to everyone, it loses it's value.
When something is "rare" or hard to earn, then only it have value. No matter what it is.

For Helen, doors of eye-sight & hearing sense were closed right in her childhood. But, this made her sense of <b>touch</b> more powerfull than an average human.
She didn't just sit there crying for what she didn't had, she successfully learned speaking & hearing even after her disabilities.

> "The man who says he can, and the man who says he can’t are both correct." -Confucius

In most cases, whatever we believe, will happen. If we believe that we can do something & try our best for long enough, it'll happen. 
But if we our-self don't believe that we can do it, we will not put our best & that task will not happen.

> "Care about what other people think and you will always be their prisoner." -Lao Tzu

When we think what others will think about our actions, we are allowing our happiness to be dependent on them. We should have our own rules for our life(and we should not let ourselves seriously affected by what other people think & say).

Even if something seems impossible, first of all we need to truly believe that <b>it is possible</b>. Then we will try to take necessary steps & chances of the result will become non-zero.
If we don't believe something is possible in the first place, probability of the result will always be zero.
