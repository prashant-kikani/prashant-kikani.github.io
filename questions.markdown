<p>Questions we should ask ourselves.</p>

1.

> If I am not happy, what is the point of everything that I am doing?

Happiness should be at the center of everything that we do. If we are losing happiness by getting something else, that's not worth it.

2.

> What part of this situation is under my control?

We should only worry about things which are in our control. There's no point thinking or worrying about things we can't control.

What things are you working on today that will play a pivotal role in your life’s goals?

Where am I going with my current actions and habits? It’s good to keep track of where we are headed.

5.

> Does the amount of attention I’m giving, match its importance?

Our attention span is limited. So, it would be better if we pay our attention to important things.

Doing small right things everyday compounds to big things of tomorrow.

It's better to think before speaking, as we can't take back our words.

8.

> Has the most important thing changed? Am I chasing an outdated target?

It's good to recalibrate our goals and destinations, they behave like a moving target.

9.

11.

> What is my short-term goal? What is my long-term goal?

It’s good to keep in mind what we want in the short term and long term.

12.

> What do I actually want from my life?

Surprisingly, many people don’t know or haven’t thought about what they actually want from their life. We must know what our goals are and how we want to live our lives.

13.

> Am I working or spending time with the right people?

Right peer group is crucial for our overall growth. Definition of “right” here, depends on person to person. But I think people who have similar goals as you are the right kind of people.

15.

> Am I working at the right level? Do I need to zoom in or zoom out?

Controlling things from the top and letting others handle the nitty gritty details enables us to keep the overall goal in mind. Sometimes, we also need to deep dive in little details though.

16.

> What is the biggest limiting factor in my goal?

17.

18.

> What is a mistake I seem to repeat every time? What can I do to prevent it this time?

Acknowledging our limitations and keeping them in mind always helps.

Taking help from the right people is a good thing. We can't do all the things.

I think we should ask ourselves these questions frequently. These questions are from my collection of questions which I collected from James Clear's 3-2-1 newsletter, which is an awesome newsletter by the way.
