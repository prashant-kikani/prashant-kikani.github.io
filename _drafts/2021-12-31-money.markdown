Money - perhaps the most important thing in today's capitalistic world. You won't be having the device in which you're reading this blog, if you would not have the money to buy it. 

But I personally fill, sometimes people measure everything and everyone by money. Yes, money is very important; but it might not be the most important thing in life. There are other things as well, like quality of relationship with family and friends, happiness, satisfaction and health!

It's not that hard to understand that why for some/most of the people money is the most important thing. We can "buy" anything/anyone with money directly or indirectly. For example, if you have your whole money part sorted out, you can enjoy your family time, you can fulfill your hobbies and dreams which will keep you happy, and you can consult any doctor/surgeon for your health.

So, high-quality relationships, happiness and health can be "bought" using money? Somewhat yes.     

But there's one more problem down the road. You see, once you have "enough" money, you get trapped into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill" target="_blank">Hedonic Adaptation</a>(aka Hedonic Treadmill). The new life-style becomes "new normal" for you.

In the above graph, we can see that our happiness increases for a short period of time, but it comes to the normal level, even if we still have those things(because of which we got happy) with us. Same for sadness. Once we lose something/someone, we get sad for a period of time, but we come to normal happiness level, even if that lose is still there. Basically, the changes(positive or negative) we experience becomes "new normal" for us. Same thing will happen for money. 

Anyway coming to the main topic, money can and will bring happiness to the life; but story does not end there. For long-lasting happiness, other things are required.

## Freedom

Money gives us freedom, that's for sure. It reveals our true self.
