In this post, I try to explore Reality and Perception. Reality is what it actually is, and perception is what we see it is.

Generally, what really is and what we see it is are same, but sometimes because of our different upbringing and backgrounds and individual's biases what we see is slightly different than the reality.
In some cases, it's super hard to know what's real in the first place. Each perception is just a point of view to the reality. There's no right or wrong way to look at reality.

In simple terms, perception is biased towards individual's background and mindset.
